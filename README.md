## Elements from the challange

1. Dividing UI into Component - Segregating the UI into multiple component efficiently so that they are neither too comapct nor too large. I have used Design thinking to achieve this.
2. Using State Management - I used global state management, Redux to showcase the effective state management technique.
3. Tailwind CSS - I have done a rapid development of writing CSS by using Tailwind CSS.
4. Testing - Used the concept of (TDD) for some components.
5. Used TypeScripts.

## If 4 more hours available.

1. I would have done thorugh testing of all the components including unit and integration. These are essentials steps in devloping a production grade app.
2. Would have used moscking server to mock the API.
3. Would have taken in account the error handling using Error Boundaries.
